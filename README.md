# serverless-reports-fan

Over a year ago we embarked on the process of optimizing reports generation in our platform, with one of the goals being and improved overall speed, i.e results delivered in less time.

The traditional programming approach we started with was a [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html) which actually worked but, if concurrent reports were to be processed, the pool quickly got exhausted. So, what about thinking bigger and going all the way to Serverless? As AWS is our platform of choice, for over 4 years already, we engineered a repeatable setup using [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) that actually delivers blazing fast performance which is not bound by server constrains but, by [AWS Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) (which you can ask for upgrades at no cost).

Unsurprinsingly, the solution taken is not too complex, but certainly functional. I'll try to describe it on a step-by-step basis:

1. Request to generate a report arrives via API Gateway, with proper parameters / criteria for report generation, which in our case usually involve:
   * Report type / id
   * Date range
   * List of assets / items to include in the report
 2. A Lambda function (f1) retrieves parameters and created an unique ID for each report.  
 3. Report generation is split based on the above list to partially gather the data for each asset/item separately, by sending an SNS with the specific parameters for each "sub-report".
 4. A separate Lambda (f2) is trigggered on a per SMS message to process each item's data and each chunk is written to a 
 row on a temporay storage (TTL set to a few hours) in a DynamoDB table.
 5. Every successful execution of Lambda f2 decrements a pending task counter and, when counter reaches zero, a final Lambda (f3) is invoked
 6. Function f3 gathers all chunks written to DynamoDB, consolidates them in the desired output format and writes it into a an S3 bucket using the report ID as part of the object keyffd.
