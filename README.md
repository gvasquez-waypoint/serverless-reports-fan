# serverless-reports-fan

Over a year ago we embarked on the process of optimizing reports generation in our platform, with one of the goals being and improved overall speed, i.e results delivered in less time.

The traditional programming approach we started with was a [ThreadPoolExecutor](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html) which actually worked but, if concurrent reports were to be processed, the pool quickly got exhausted. So, what about thinking bigger and going all the way to Serverless? As AWS is our platform of choice, for over 4 years already, we engineered a repeatable setup using [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/), [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb) that actually delivers blazing fast performance which is not bound by server constrains but, by [AWS Service Limits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) (which you can ask for upgrades at no cost).
